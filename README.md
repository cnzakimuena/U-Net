# U-Net

Implementation of image segmentation with a U-Net-like architecture (by F. Chollet) (https://keras.io/examples/vision/oxford_pets_image_segmentation/).  To download the dataset, first navigate to the provided web addresses (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/data/images.tar.gz and  https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/data/annotations.tar.gz).  The downloaded files are compressed as files with both '.gz' and '.tar' extensions.  To extract the downloaded file, right click and select the appropriate software (e.g. 7-Zip) and select 'Extract Here' twice for each file.

The Xception architecture is described here:
